## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

### Tech Stack in Production
```
Frontend (React + Vite)
    ↓ HTTP/HTTPS
Backend (Express + Node.js)
    ↓ Prisma ORM
Database (PostgreSQL)
```

### Authentication Flow
```
User Login → Backend validates → JWT generated →
Stored in localStorage → Included in all requests →
Backend verifies → Protected resource access
```

### Data Flow
```
User Action → React Component → Zustand/React Query →
API Client (Axios) → Backend Route → Service Layer →
Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL → Response → UI Update
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

**Optimizations Implemented:**
- React Query caching for API responses
- Zustand for efficient client state
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Lazy loading of routes (can be added)
