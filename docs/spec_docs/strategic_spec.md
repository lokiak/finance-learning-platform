# PERSONAL FINANCE + AI COURSE: COMPLETE SPECIFICATION

## COURSE OVERVIEW

**Working Title:** Building Your Financial Future: A Practical Guide to Money, Investing, and Wealth (with AI & Spreadsheets)

**Target Audience:**
Ages 18-30, early to mid-career professionals and individuals who feel anxious, overwhelmed, or ashamed about money. They avoid learning about finances because it feels complicated, boring, or like they're "too far behind." No prior finance or spreadsheet experience required.

**What They Want:**
- To stop feeling helpless or paralyzed about money
- To build toward specific dreams (owning a home, retiring comfortably, traveling, starting a business)
- To understand investing without getting lost in jargon
- To feel like wealth-building is actually possible for them

**Course Philosophy:**
This isn't about becoming an accountant or day trader. This is about building the life you want - owning a home, retiring comfortably, having financial security - and using AI and spreadsheets as power tools to get there. This is life-building finance, not spreadsheet finance. But spreadsheet literacy is a critical empowerment tool that helps students model their own future and take ownership of their financial journey.

**AI Integration Approach:**
Teaching finance with AI as a thinking partner - not just answering "what is a Roth IRA?" but helping them think through their specific situation, goals, and next steps. AI is positioned as "here's a tool that helps you execute this concept" not "let's philosophize about AI's impact on economic systems."

**Spreadsheet Integration Approach:**
Progressive skill-building from basic data entry to complex financial modeling. Spreadsheet literacy reinforces the empowerment angle: "I can model my own financial future, not just trust someone else's calculator." Students build practical tools they'll use for years.

## WHAT MAKES THIS COURSE UNIQUE

1. **Anxiety reduction focus** - Meeting students where they are emotionally, addressing shame and fear directly

2. **Life-building, not accounting** - Focused on real goals (homes, retirement, freedom) not abstract financial concepts

3. **Progressive skill building** - Spreadsheets and AI taught alongside finance, building from basic to advanced

4. **Practical deliverables** - Students build real tools they'll use for years, not just consume information

5. **AI as thinking partner** - Strategic AI integration at leverage points, not gimmicky "ask ChatGPT for everything"

6. **Empowerment through ownership** - Students control their financial models and understand every piece of their system

7. **Action within each module** - Concept → System → Execution happens within each phase, not separated

8. **Comprehensive but focused** - Covers everything the target audience needs without scope creep into advanced topics

9. **Debt integration** - Addresses the elephant in the room that most personal finance courses skip or minimize

10. **30-year vision** - Not just "how to start investing" but "how to build and maintain wealth for life"

## TEACHING METHODOLOGY

**Core Pattern (Used Throughout):**

Each module follows this structure:
1. Core concept explained (the "why" and "how")
2. Brief context when helpful (never more than 2 minutes, always tied to action)
3. AI integration at leverage points (personalization, calculations, decision support)
4. Spreadsheet building (progressive skill development)
5. Immediate action step (this week, not "someday")

**Context Integration Rules:**
- Appears only when it helps clarify "why this works" or "why this matters"
- Never exceeds 2 minutes
- Always connects directly to practical action
- Never derails the main learning objective
- Can be positioned as optional for students who want deeper understanding

**AI Integration Strategy:**
- Positioned as a tool that amplifies human thinking, not replaces it
- Specific prompts provided at decision points
- Focus on personalization, scenario modeling, and getting unstuck
- Not used for every single task - only where it adds genuine value
- Teaches critical thinking about AI responses, not blind acceptance

**Spreadsheet Progression:**
- Phase 1: Basic skills (data entry, simple formulas, categories)
- Phase 2: Intermediate skills (financial functions, charts, tracking)
- Phase 3: Advanced skills (complex modeling, scenarios, integration)
- Phase 4: Mastery skills (optimization, automation, lifetime projection)

**Emotional Progression:**
- Acknowledge anxiety and shame at the start
- Build confidence through small wins
- Celebrate milestones throughout
- Frame setbacks as normal and manageable
- End with empowerment and long-term vision
